#Description:
#    This test will verify that executing remove_snapshot when there are
#    no snapshots generates an error message and no remove snapshot plan
#    is created.
#      1. Attempt to delete the non existent snapshot.
#      2. Verify that the user is told that no snapshot currently exists
#Result:
#    Executing remove_snapshot when there are no snapshots generates an
#    error message and no remove snapshot plan is created.
